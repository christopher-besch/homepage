# Notes

- revealjs as is
- my compilation method + problems
- all from same site, no CDN
- template
- my needs, decisions: interactivity not needed, simple, pretty, animated
- methods:
    - title page header
    - half_part, general alignment
    - lists
    - headings
    - animations
    - quotes
    - images (LaTeX with transparent background)
    - tables
    - equations (align, not align, drawbacks)
    - markings in equations
    - colouring
    - links
- what doesn't work, why shouldn't use revealjs
