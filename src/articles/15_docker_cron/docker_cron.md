I have this voice in my head.
When I create, it notifies me about things I shouldn't do or use.
The below article is about that voice.

The other day I set up [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com), a bot that continuously scans my code for outdated dependencies.
I chose to deploy it via Docker.
Then the problem arose of starting Renovate at regular intervals.
