I have this voice in my head.
When I create, it highlights things I should be cautious of using.
It is on high alert when some dependency relies on external servers;
external servers that could go dark at any moment.
Or when I consider something hacky that will fall apart too soon.
Or in those situations I feel too smart and come up with too clever a solution when.
That voice is basically the gegenspieler of not simple enough things.

The below article is about when to quell that voice.

The other day I set up [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com), a bot that continuously scans my code for outdated dependencies.
I chose to deploy it via Docker.
Then the problem arose of starting Renovate at regular intervals.
