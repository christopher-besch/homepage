Blogging is amazing.
Everyone tends to their own plot of shared knowledge.
Here I'm linking to some of what I enjoyed visiting.
I invite you to try out this form of socializing, too.
Read, write, link — all without a corporation pulling it down in a few years.
If you have something to recommend, feel free to tell me at [mail@chris-besch.com](mailto:mail@chris-besch.com) or create a page like this.
