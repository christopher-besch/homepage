I won't hide my love for Open-Source.
While I've structued this article to only come to the conclusion that Open-Source is amazing, it's been more the other way around.
I love Open-Source and want to put all that into words.

This article doesn't require any technical knowledge.

So, how did things use to work.
Picture a mechanical kitchen scale.
You know, the thing you weigh flour with.
And now consider a mechanical one, without batteries, without microprocessors, just metal, gears and springs.
You want to own a mechanical kitchen scale because you need it.
When you go to the manufacturer, money in-hand, what do you expect to receive?
A scale, of course.
Let's look at it.

What if you want to modify it in some way?
Maybe you want to change it's color or replace the keycaps.
What do you need to do that?

Now fast-forward half a century and now we don't use typewriters any more.
We use personal computers, machines capable of all kinds of work.
You can use the same computer for different tasks by installing a different application on it.
All they need is 

Let's look at a different thing:
A text processing program, something like LibreOffice Writer or Word or Google Docs.
You have some document to write and go to a manufacturer, money in-hand.
What do you expect to receive.
You already have a personal computer running an operating system like Linux or Windows or macOS.
To use your text processor you need a piece a binary executable.
A binary executable is a piece of compiled source code.

I argue this is a fundamentally different situation.
What we've been doing before, receive the thing that we need right now, i.e., the executable is not enough.

Also, what world is this?
What life is this when we all walk among things we can't touch or open or tinker with.

When you're surrounded by Open-Source systems you are invited, encouraged, to interact with the world differently.
You aren't waiting for some corporation approving your access request and giving you the secret source-code.
You can just grab the source of the things you love and look at how they work, you can discuss how they work, you can discuss how safe they are.
And, of course, you can change them, create your own or improve.
From this perspective, Open-Source really is just an entirely different mind-set, a mind-set of openness, that **you** are the one to change things.
Everyone is.
Everyone is!
Damn, EDM is pretty great.
I have no idea how I should pour this into something more coherent but typing is fun!

Thank goodness, we don't do this in the military sector.
Just imagine what power the manufacturer, and the manufacturer's country, would have over the customer.
Wait a moment!

When something is closed-source that means the manufacturer doesn't want you, the customer, to understand the product.
It means their business model somehow depends on everyone else not understanding this, not grasping it, not being allowed to play with it, work with it, tinker with it.
I think, in the world that we and software live in, that is horrible and doomed to failure.
Especially security requires as many people (users) to understand as much of the world as possible.
That's why we need as much Open-Source as possible.

Let's start by stating that software is fundamentally different to everything that has come before.

Fundamentally, 

If you don't do that, if you don't pick up the developer hat and take a look behind the scenes, you still benefit from others doing so.

You get safer, cheaper, higher-quality, sovereign products.

Sometimes people, more specifically my bosses at IBM, ask me why the hell we should open-source something.
Who would ever want to look at the code for this server application.
Well, it's about the principle.
It has always been about the principle, the mind-set, the society.
That's all about the principles.
And the principle is to publish as a default and, maybe, keep things private if there are really good reasons not to.

The arrival of software changed things.
Open-Source is the response to that change.

- easy to change (i.e. satellite)
- easy to do yourself
- look **and** touch
- security -> ongoing support
- final product inherently opaque
- 

Furthermore, the final software product is inherently opaque.
You cannot easily look into a binary and figure out what it does or change it.
There's an entire science dedicated to trying anyways, reverse engineering.

- hate depending on things
- hate having things taken away from me
- hate when tools get in the way
- Einstiegsdiskussionsfrage
- in neue Bereiche einarbeiten
- Autonomie durch Forken -> Demokratie

- Problem: oft Abhängig von einzelnen Entwicklern
- Bug-Resilience-Projekt: Investition in Sicherheit

- self-governing, self-organizing community
- do not repeat yourself, but supply-chain attacks
- differnt mind-set: **you** are the one capable of changing things, improving things -> Democracy
- Digitale Souveränität

- Perspektiven: Nutzer, Entwickler, 

# Chris
- mehr als Code: text, wikipedia, hardware
- Konzept
- public code < open-source
- jeder kann zu gleichen Teilen mitwirken
- demokratisch?
- Stolz auf Code, so sehr, dass ich will, dass jemand draufschaut
- Feature Request zu Pull Request schnell -> Feature Complete durch Demokratie, Meinungsfreiheit

- Problem: GitHub als Platform
- Problem: Maintainer machen keinen guten Job in Lineage OS

### Als Nutzer
- bessere Software im Allgemeinen
- bessere Software durch keine Pop-ups
- mitwirken als Entwickler
- viel von Entwickler für Entwickler
    - viel manuel zu konfigurieren
- manches gibt es nicht in Open-Source, Kleinigkeiten ein Problem für nicht-Entwickler
- kein Support
- keine Haftung
- kein Vendor lock-in
- Wechsel: Windows -> macOS vs Fedore GNOME -> Debian GNOME

### Als Firma, Dienstleister
- Wichtig: Support, Hosting, Haftung, SLAs, Zertifizierungen
- DRM schwierig
- Auftraggeber muss komplette Entwicklung bezahlen
- Supportvertrag -> Geldquelle

### Als Bürger
- Ohne Vendor lock-in, wenn der Kunde entscheiden kann, wenn es tatsächlich Konkurenz gibt, dann funktioniert Kapitalismug -> weniger Optionen
  Open-Source macht Wechsel einfacher -> bessere Welt (z.B. )
- bessere Dienste durch bessere Konkurenz
- Grundgesetz Rechte lagen bei Verlag, jetzt: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/BJNR000010949.html
  Gleiches für Software
- PCWahl: keine Sicherheit durch offene Software
- Autonomie von USA, Microsoft
- DSGVO
- Frankreich Office Suite?
- Behörde geht zu SAP: Entwickel das Open-Source
- Software (SaaS) ist kein Stück Munition oder Service, der abgeschlossen ist und komplett dem Kunden gegeben wird
  Software muss sich ändern, weiterentwickelt werden, Sicherheitsupdates, Software ist nie fertig, Laufender Prozess
- Public Money, Public Code
- Ownership: keine Lizens, sondern Besitz des Codes -> teurer
- EU Sammlung an Software
- Flickenteppich kostet Zeit und Geld

### Wo nicht
- Militär 
- aber: KPMG Reaktor im Geheimen, Probleme (Positive Voide, Runaway Void) bekannt aber geheim
- Open-Source as a default, manche Bereiche heikel

### China?
- 
- RiscV
