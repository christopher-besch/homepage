                    This privacy policy will explain how I and any necessary third-party services use the personal data collected from you when you use my website.
                </p>

                <h1>What data do I collect?</h1>
                <p>
                    This website uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics">Cloudflare Web Analytics</a>, which collects the following data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>time of access,</li>
                        <li>what page you read,</li>
                        <li>your operating system (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, ...),</li>
                        <li>your browser,</li>
                        <li>if you're using a mobile device,</li>
                        <li>the referer (i.e. the page that linked you to my homepage),</li>
                        <li>from what country you're accesing my homepage and</li>
                        <li>some website diagnostics, like how long my homepage takes to load for you.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This data is anonymized.
                    So I for example only know that ten people from Belgium visited my <Link to="/articles/revealjs">article about reveal.js</Link> this monthâ€”not that <b>you</b> visited my page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This data is only accessible by Cloudflare (for six months) and myself.
                    Short overviews of the data are kept indefinitely by me and I might publish them in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This data is used to help me understand what topics people are interested in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to that, my hoster <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> keeps an access log required to operate this website.
                    This access log includes most notably your IP address and access time stamps, which are stored (by Netlify) for less than 30 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your IP address can be used to determine your rough physical location.
                    If you intend to keep your position secret, you are advised to utilize an anonymizing service such as the <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Network</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your access time stamp can be used to identify you temporal location.
                    As of today, there is no established method of changing the flow of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should read <a href="https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa">Netlify's privacy policy</a> as their privacy notice applies.
