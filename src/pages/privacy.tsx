                    This privacy policy will explain how I and any necessary third-party services use the personal data collected from you when you use my website.

                <h1>tl;dr</h1>
                <p>
                    This website collects your IP address; you should read <a href="https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa">Netlify's privacy policy</a>.
                </p>

                <h1>What data do I collect?</h1>
                <p>
                    I myself don't collect any personal data.
                    Though my hoster <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> does keep an access log required to operate this website.
                    This access log includes most notably your IP address and access time stamps, which are stored (by Netlify) for less than 30 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your IP address can be used to determine your rough physical location.
                    If you intend to keep your position secret, you are advised to utilize an anonymizing service such as the <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Network</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your access time stamp can be used to identify you temporal location.
                    As of today, there is no established method of changing the flow of time.
                </p>

                    You should read <a href="https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa">Netlify's privacy policy</a> as their privacy notice applies.
