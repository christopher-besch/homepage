I use Debian but this setup should work on all Linux distros (and maybe macOS and BSD?).\n2. [Install node and npm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script).\n3. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install).\n4. Install [gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum).\n   This is entirely optional.\n   If you don't install gotestsum, ignore all the `USE_GOTESTSUM=yes` statements below.\n5. Download the [Forgejo Repo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo) with `git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo ~/forgejo && cd ~/forgejo`.\n6. Build an executable with `STRIP=\"0\" EXTRA_GOFLAGS='-gcflags=\"all=-N -l\"' TAGS=\"sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify\" make build`.\n   It took me a while to realize that `go build` enables optimization by default but keeps all debug symbols present.\n   We change that with the `gsflags` by neither optimizing or inlining.\n   Furthermore, Forgejo's Makefile strips the debug symbols so we disable that with the `STRIP` environment variable.\n7. Run `./gitea`.\n   Yes, the executable is still called that.\n8. Open a webbrowser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n9. Choose SQLite, create an admin account and keep everything else default.\n   Your config is in `~/forgejo/custom/conf/app.ini`.\n10. Create the `test_repo` repository and add the file `.forgejo/workflows/main.yml`:\n    ```yaml\n    enable-email-notifications: true\n    on:\n      workflow_dispatch:\n    \n    jobs:\n      test:\n        runs-on: self-hosted\n        steps:\n          - name: Echo\n            run: |\n              echo Hello World!\n          - name: Fail\n            run: |\n              false\n    ```\n    You can make your life a little easier by cloning the repo: `git clone http://localhost:3000/chris_admin/test_repo.git ~forgejo_test_repo`.\n    You'll have to follow the prompts and configure your `user.email` and `user.name`.\n    I'm using password login, btw.\n\n### Forgejo Runner\nTo test workflow I need a runner.\n1. Download the [Forgejo runner binary](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo/runner/releases) into `~/forgejo_runner`.\n2. Register the runner with `./forgejo-runner-11.1.2-linux-amd64 register`, give the instance URL `http://localhost:3000`, the runner token you get from the repo settings in the web interface, choose a name like `test-runner` and select the label `self-hosted:host`.\n3. Run `./forgejo-runner-11.1.2-linux-amd64 daemon` and click the workflow trigger button in the web interface.\n   You should see your workflow run now.\n\n### Mail Server\nOkay, that works fine but we also want to test sending emails.\nI use [MailDev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) to create a development email server.\nIt provides an SMTP server, which Forgejo connects to, and a webinterface for me, the developer.\n1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).\n2. Run `docker run --network host -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 maildev/maildev`.\n3. Open [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) in a webbrowser.\n4. Shutdown Forgejo and edit it's config (in `~/forgejo/custom/conf/app.ini`).\n   ```ini\n   [mailer]\n   ENABLED = true\n   PROTOCOL = smtp\n   SMTP_ADDR = localhost\n   SMTP_PORT = 1025\n   FROM = forgejo@localhost\n\n   # make sure this is true\n   [service]\n   ENABLE_NOTIFY_MAIL = true\n   ```\n5. Now, when the workflow fails you should get a mail in the MailDev web interface.\n\n### Webhook\nFurthermore, we want to test webhooks.\n1. I'm using [this node script](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46787467) as a test webhook:\n   `webhook_tester.js`:\n   ```js\n   #!/usr/bin/env node\n\n   const http = require(\"http\");\n\n   const hostname = \"0.0.0.0\";\n   const port = 8001;\n\n   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n     console.log(`\\n${req.method} ${req.url}`);\n     console.log(req.headers);\n\n     req.on(\"data\", function(chunk) {\n       console.log(\"BODY: \" + chunk);\n     });\n\n     res.statusCode = 200;\n     res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n     res.end(\"Hello World\\n\");\n   });\n\n   server.listen(port, hostname, () => {\n     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);\n   });\n   ```\n2. Run `./webhook_tester.js`.\n3. Shutdown Forgejo and edit it's config (in `~/forgejo/custom/conf/app.ini`).\n   For Forgejo to accept `http://localhost:8001` as a webhook target you need to add this:\n   ```ini\n   [webhook]\n   ALLOWED_HOST_LIST = *\n   SKIP_TLS_VERIFY = true\n   ```\n4. Create a new webhook in the Repo Settings and use the target URL `http://localhost:8001`.\n   Enable either *All events* or *Custom events*, selecting the *Action Run events*.\n5. Start the workflow, let it fail and watch the sent webhook in the node terminal.\n\nNow we have everything to play with the features I implemented.\n\n## Running Tests\nForejeo has different types of tests.\nI was concerned with these types.\n- Run all unit tests with `TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' USE_GOTESTSUM=yes make test`.\n- Run all integration tests with `TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' USE_GOTESTSUM=yes make test-sqlite`.\n\nSay you only want to run this unit test in `~/forgejo/models/actions/run_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestGetRunBefore(t *testing.T) {\n  // --snip--\n}\n```\nThen you can execute `USE_GOTESTSUM=yes TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' GO_TEST_PACKAGES='forgejo.org/models/actions' make 'test#TestGetRunBefore'`.\nBut what if, instead, you are concerned with this integration test in `~/forgejo/tests/integration/actions_notifications_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestActionNotifications(t *testing.T) {\n  // --snip--\n}\n```\nThen you can run `USE_GOTESTSUM=yes TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' make 'test-sqlite#TestActionNotifications'`.\nBtw, there are other types of tests, namely frontend tests and the End-to-End tests in a [special repo](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo/end-to-end).\nI didn't work with these yet so I direct you to the [testing docs](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/contributor/testing).\n\n## Debugging\nI like the terminal and am used to GDB.\nTherefore, I'm using the terminal debugger [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve).\nLet's set things up for that:\n1. [Install Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation).\n2. Build Forgejo as described [above](#development-setup).\n3. Run `dlv exec ./gitea`.\n4. Now we can use the Delve console while Forgejo runs, letting you interact with the web interface.\n   For example you can do `break forgejo.org/services/mailer.(*mailNotifier).ActionRunNowDone`, `break forgejo.org/services/notify.ActionRunNowDone` and `continue`.\n   Hit `Ctrl+C` to enter a Delve command and type `quit` to exit.\n\nSay you want to debug the above unit test.\nThen you can use Delve with this command: `dlv test --build-flags \"-tags='sqlite,sqlite_unlock_notify' -run TestGetRunBefore\" forgejo.org/models/actions`.\nIf, instead,  you want to debug the above integration test, run `make integrations.sqlite.test generate-ini-sqlite && GITEA_ROOT=\"$(pwd)\" GITEA_CONF=tests/sqlite.ini dlv exec ./integrations.sqlite.test -- -test.run TestActionNotifications`.\nHere you can break on some line number, too: `break ./tests/integration/actions_notifications_test.go:22`\nTo debug something else, take a look at Forgejo's Makefile and find what command make the things you want to debug run.\nJust replace `go test` with `delve` and place all `go test` arguments in the `--build_flags` Delve argument.\nYou can break on line numbers, too: `break ./models/actions/run_test.go:19`\n\n## Forgejo's Observer Pattern\nLet's talk about Forgejo's architecture.\nFirstly, the directory structure.\n- `models`: SQL helper stuff, access to nothing\n- `modules`: Things that don't need database or git access.\n- `services`: Things that do need database and/or git access.\n- `routers`: \n\nForgejos\n[Forgejo's architecture overview](https://forgejo.org/docs/next/contributor/architecture) is quite helpful.\n\n<HalfImage full={true} src={architecture} />\n\nTODO\n\n- duplicity of structs\n\n## My Changes\nTODO\n\n- [#7510: Refactoring](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7510)\n- [#7491: Actions Done Notification](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7491)\n- [#7697: After the Fact Cleanup](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7697)\n- [#7509: Actions Done Mail](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7509)\n- [#7508: Actions Done Webhook](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7508)\n- at same time to #7508 [#7699: (not mine) introduce ActionRun, too](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7508)\n- [#8066: (not mine) rename #7699's struct to RepoActionRun](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8066)\n- [#8250: (not mine) unify ActionRun and RepoActionRun](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8250)\n- [#8227: (not mine) Only single user receives mail](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8227)\n- [#8242: (not mine) actions mail opt-in](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8242)\n\n## Testing my Features\nTODO\n\n## Conclusion and Lessons Learned\nTODO\n\n- architecture of Forgejo notifications\n- importance of tests, what tests I wrote\n- testing setup, I didn't have that much time directly after all PRs -> tests vital\n- think of testing not as a side-gig!\n- break things up into multiple PRs\n- less code is better\n- understand as much as possible, then make the minimal change that is needed (knock someone out with your pinky)\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Friday, 21st November, 2025","title":"Forgejo Actions Notification Development","description":" Some stories of how I work on Forgejo.
