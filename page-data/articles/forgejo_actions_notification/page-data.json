mainly because of the `replace` statement above.\nIt states that while the Forgejo's Go source code will `import github.com/hashicorp/go-version`, the go tooling should download it from `github.com/6543/go-version` instead.\nIn this case Forgejo uses `replace` to switch to a fork.\n\nAs we've seen, Go code is grouped in modules but there's another level of granularity: packages.\nGo uses packages to isolate code into neat, contained, well, packages.\nEvery Go file declares what package they are in.\nGo code can use exported and not-exported symbols inside its own package (i.e., functions, values, etc.).\nTo use symbols in other packages, however, they must be exported and you need to import that other package.<br />\nThe package `main` is special, that's where the entrypoint is.\nTake a look at Forgejo's [`main.go`](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/main.go):\n```go\n// /main.go\n// --snip--\npackage main\nimport (\n    // [standard library imports]\n    \"os\"\n    \"runtime\"\n    // --snip--\n\n    // [import some other package from the Forgejo source code repo]\n    \"forgejo.org/cmd\"\n// --snip--\n)\n// --snip--\nfunc main() {\n    // --snip--\n```\nNow, this is what really confused me at first:\n`forgejo.org` is a domain you can visit with your browser but that's more or less just a coincidence.\nGo only uses it to identify Forgejo's main package's path.\nTherefore, `forgejo.org/cmd` is not a web endpoint at all, even though it might look like one.\nInstead, it refers to the package `cmd` located in the [`/cmd` directory](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/cmd).\n```go\n// /cmd/main.go\n// --snip--\npackage cmd\n\nimport (\n    // --snip--\n    \"forgejo.org/modules/log\"\n    // --snip--\n    \"github.com/urfave/cli/v3\"\n// --snip--\n```\nAnd the `forgejo.org/cmd` package imports some more packages.\nWhen you read this, be aware of the to-be-imported package's location in the directory structure.\nThe package lies in the [`/modules/log`](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/modules/log) directory of the `forgejo.org` module, thus `forgejo.org/modules/log` refers to it.\n`github.com/urfave/cli/v3`, however, refers to a dependency Go will download from GitHub during a build.\nThe includes look so similar but one is resolved locally and the other from the internet.<br />\nNotice that the Go files in the `forgejo.org/modules/log` package declare their package without its full path:\n```go\n// /modules/log/init.go\n// --snip--\npackage log\n// --snip--\n```\nIt only says `log` but the full package path required to import the package is `forgejo.org/modules/log`.\nRemember how the directory Go code lies in influences any package's path.\n\n## Forgejo's Layered Architecture\nThis article is about implementing one specific feature, actions notifications.\nTherefore, I'll only talk about the parts of Forgejo's architecture that matter for this feature.\nFirstly, we take a look at Forgejo's layered [architecture](https://forgejo.org/docs/next/contributor/architecture), which I've created a visualization of:\n\n<HalfImage full={true} src={architecture} />\n\n`\\routers`, `\\services`, `\\models`, `\\modules` and `\\templates` are the *main directories* where most of Forgejo's Go code lives.\nAs we can see, there are three layers.\nFirstly, code in the bottom layers may only access packages inside their respective main directory.\nSo for example, code in `\\modules` may not access the Forgejo-specific database models defined in `\\models`.\n(The Go compiler doesn't enforce this, code reviewers do.)\nPackages in `\\modules` could theoretically be used as a library outside of Forgejo.\nSecondly, the `\\services` module may access both `\\models` and `\\modules` but not the `\\routers` above.\nFinally, the `\\routers` code may use everything below it.<br />\nThere are other main directories that we don't care about.\nFurthermore, I've only drawn example packages, files and structs inside the main directories.\nThey contain a lot more things; things we'll look at later.\nLastly, the `api` package inside `\\routers` doesn't actually contain any Go code directly.\nInstead it is the parent-package of packages like `forgejo.org/services/api/actions/runner`.\n\nNaturally, we want as little code as possible in the upper layers.\nCode in such layers is a lot harder to reason about.\nAfter all it has access to so much stuff with so many effects and side-effects.\nThis will become important when I talk about the refactoring my feature required.\n\n## Forgejo's Observer Pattern\nWe've seen how Go packages may include other Go packages.\nThere's one problem with that:\n\nTODO: cyclic stuff -> solution observer pattern\n\n- duplicity of structs\n\n## My Changes\nTODO\n```\n~/forgejo λ vit lg | grep -P '\\(#(7510|7491|7697|7509|7508|8066|8250|8227|8242)\\)'\ncf4d0e6c34 b2c4fc9f94 9e6f722f94 2529923dea d17aa98262 386e7f8208 95ad7d6201 05273fa8d2 a783a72d6b\n\n(git log --pretty=format: --name-only cf4d0e6c34~..cf4d0e6c34 ;

I use Debian but this setup should work on all Linux distros (and maybe macOS and BSD?).\n2. [Install node and npm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script).\n3. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install).\n4. Install [gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum).\n   This is entirely optional.\n   If you don't install gotestsum, ignore all the `USE_GOTESTSUM=yes` statements below.\n5. Download the [Forgejo Repo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo) with `git clone https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo ~/forgejo && cd ~/forgejo`.\n6. Build an executable with `STRIP=\"0\" EXTRA_GOFLAGS='-gcflags=\"all=-N -l\"' TAGS=\"sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify\" make build`.\n   It took me a while to realize that `go build` enables optimization by default but keeps all debug symbols present.\n   We change that with the `gsflags` by neither optimizing or inlining.\n   Furthermore, Forgejo's Makefile strips the debug symbols so we disable that with the `STRIP` environment variable.\n7. Run `./gitea`.\n   Yes, the executable is still called that.\n8. Open a webbrowser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n9. Choose SQLite, create an admin account and keep everything else default.\n   Your config is in `~/forgejo/custom/conf/app.ini`.\n10. Create the `test_repo` repository and add the file `.forgejo/workflows/main.yml`:\n    ```yaml\n    enable-email-notifications: true\n    on:\n      workflow_dispatch:\n    \n    jobs:\n      test:\n        runs-on: self-hosted\n        steps:\n          - name: Echo\n            run: |\n              echo Hello World!\n          - name: Fail\n            run: |\n              false\n    ```\n    You can make your life a little easier by cloning the repo: `git clone http://localhost:3000/chris_admin/test_repo.git ~forgejo_test_repo`.\n    You'll have to follow the prompts and configure your `user.email` and `user.name`.\n    I'm using password login, btw.\n\n### Forgejo Runner\nTo test workflow I need a runner.\n1. Download the [Forgejo runner binary](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo/runner/releases) into `~/forgejo_runner`.\n2. Register the runner with `./forgejo-runner-11.1.2-linux-amd64 register`, give the instance URL `http://localhost:3000`, the runner token you get from the repo settings in the web interface, choose a name like `test-runner` and select the label `self-hosted:host`.\n3. Run `./forgejo-runner-11.1.2-linux-amd64 daemon` and click the workflow trigger button in the web interface.\n   You should see your workflow run now.\n\n### Mail Server\nOkay, that works fine but we also want to test sending emails.\nI use [MailDev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) to create a development email server.\nIt provides an SMTP server, which Forgejo connects to, and a webinterface for me, the developer.\n1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).\n2. Run `docker run --network host -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 maildev/maildev`.\n3. Open [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) in a webbrowser.\n4. Shutdown Forgejo and edit it's config (in `~/forgejo/custom/conf/app.ini`).\n   ```ini\n   [mailer]\n   ENABLED = true\n   PROTOCOL = smtp\n   SMTP_ADDR = localhost\n   SMTP_PORT = 1025\n   FROM = forgejo@localhost\n\n   # make sure this is true\n   [service]\n   ENABLE_NOTIFY_MAIL = true\n   ```\n5. Now, when the workflow fails you should get a mail in the MailDev web interface.\n\n### Webhook\nFurthermore, we want to test webhooks.\n1. I'm using [this node script](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46787467) as a test webhook:\n   `webhook_tester.js`:\n   ```js\n   #!/usr/bin/env node\n\n   const http = require(\"http\");\n\n   const hostname = \"0.0.0.0\";\n   const port = 8001;\n\n   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n     console.log(`\\n${req.method} ${req.url}`);\n     console.log(req.headers);\n\n     req.on(\"data\", function(chunk) {\n       console.log(\"BODY: \" + chunk);\n     });\n\n     res.statusCode = 200;\n     res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n     res.end(\"Hello World\\n\");\n   });\n\n   server.listen(port, hostname, () => {\n     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);\n   });\n   ```\n2. Run `./webhook_tester.js`.\n3. Shutdown Forgejo and edit it's config (in `~/forgejo/custom/conf/app.ini`).\n   For Forgejo to accept `http://localhost:8001` as a webhook target you need to add this:\n   ```ini\n   [webhook]\n   ALLOWED_HOST_LIST = *\n   SKIP_TLS_VERIFY = true\n   ```\n4. Create a new webhook in the Repo Settings and use the target URL `http://localhost:8001`.\n   Enable either *All events* or *Custom events*, selecting the *Action Run events*.\n5. Start the workflow, let it fail and watch the sent webhook in the node terminal.\n\nNow we have everything to play with the features I implemented.\n\n## Running Tests\nForejeo has different types of tests.\nI was concerned with these types.\n- Run all unit tests with `TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' USE_GOTESTSUM=yes make test`.\n- Run all integration tests with `TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' USE_GOTESTSUM=yes make test-sqlite`.\n\nSay you only want to run this unit test in `~/forgejo/models/actions/run_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestGetRunBefore(t *testing.T) {\n  // --snip--\n}\n```\nThen you can execute `USE_GOTESTSUM=yes TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' GO_TEST_PACKAGES='forgejo.org/models/actions' make 'test#TestGetRunBefore'`.\nBut what if, instead, you are concerned with this integration test in `~/forgejo/tests/integration/actions_notifications_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestActionNotifications(t *testing.T) {\n  // --snip--\n}\n```\nThen you can run `USE_GOTESTSUM=yes TAGS='sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify' make 'test-sqlite#TestActionNotifications'`.\nBtw, there are other types of tests, namely frontend tests and the End-to-End tests in a [special repo](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo/end-to-end).\nI didn't work with these yet so I direct you to the [testing docs](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/contributor/testing).\n\n## Debugging\nI like the terminal and am used to GDB.\nTherefore, I'm using the terminal debugger [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve).\nLet's set things up for that:\n1. [Install Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation).\n2. Build Forgejo as described [above](#development-setup).\n3. Run `dlv exec ./gitea`.\n4. Now we can use the Delve console while Forgejo runs, letting you interact with the web interface.\n   For example you can do `break forgejo.org/services/mailer.(*mailNotifier).ActionRunNowDone`, `break forgejo.org/services/notify.ActionRunNowDone` and `continue`.\n   Hit `Ctrl+C` to enter a Delve command and type `quit` to exit.\n\nSay you want to debug the above unit test.\nThen you can use Delve with this command: `dlv test --build-flags \"-tags='sqlite,sqlite_unlock_notify' -run TestGetRunBefore\" forgejo.org/models/actions`.\nIf, instead,  you want to debug the above integration test, run `make integrations.sqlite.test generate-ini-sqlite && GITEA_ROOT=\"$(pwd)\" GITEA_CONF=tests/sqlite.ini dlv exec ./integrations.sqlite.test -- -test.run TestActionNotifications`.\nHere you can break on some line number, too: `break ./tests/integration/actions_notifications_test.go:22`\nTo debug something else, take a look at Forgejo's Makefile and find what command make the things you want to debug run.\nJust replace `go test` with `delve` and place all `go test` arguments in the `--build_flags` Delve argument.\nYou can break on line numbers, too: `break ./models/actions/run_test.go:19`\n\n\n## Conclusion and Lessons Learned\nTODO\n\n- architecture of Forgejo notifications\n- importance of tests, what tests I wrote\n- testing setup, I didn't have that much time directly after all PRs -> tests vital\n- think of testing not as a side-gig!\n- break things up into multiple PRs\n- less code is better\n- understand as much as possible, then make the minimal change that is needed (knock someone out with your pinky)\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Friday, 21st November, 2025","title":"Forgejo Actions Notification Development","description":" Some stories of how I work on Forgejo.
