<br />\nCue the first problem:\ncron isn't already installed inside the Renovate container.\nWhat do you do?\nYou add the entrypoint script back and make it install cron from the Debian repositories.\nLet's hope those haven't gone dark when you want to restart your container.\nOh, and that of course doesn't work for containers that shouldn't have any access to the internet.\nThat's actually a bunch of my containers.\n\nBut there's another problem: stdout.\nFor debugging purposes I want access to Renovate's log output.\nDocker already provides a way to store a process' log output.\nFor this the Docker daemon attaches to the stdout of the container's main process.\nIn our case the main process is cron and not Renovate because cron lauches it's commands in the background.\nTherefore, the Renovate's log output is lost.\nWhat you have to do is redirect the bot's stdout to cron's stdout.\nThat's quite a complicated thing to do and there is a lot to trip over.\nAnd you know what?\nThat feels like a hack â€” a hack making that bitter feeling flare up again.\nSo this alternative solution felt simpler at first but turned out causing a bunch of other problems requiring workarounds and trade-offs.\n\nWhich solution do you want to use?\nThough you could argue both ways, personally I prefer docker_cron and will keep using it.\nI find the security implications acceptable considering how easy to review docker_cron is. <br />\nUnfortunately, this Renovate-endeavour of mine didn't rid myself of that bitter feeling.\nAfter all I didn't actually improve docker_cron, I only showed that the alternative is worse.\nIn a perfect world Docker itself offers some form of cron support.\nMy docker_cron solution, right now, is the next best thing and all it's problems originate from a carefully weighted trade-off.\nNow it's on me to accept that and keep going.\n\n## What Remains\nWhat remains at the end of this more personal article?\nAn article I mostly wrote for myself, that is.\nLet's put it this way: <br />\nCriteria like code smells, best practices and the like can only get you so far.\nAt some level of problem complexity you need to compromise.\nThen you trade one best practice against some other.\nThat's normal.\nWhat's important is **when** you have these considerations: <br />\nWhen you design the architecture, this is fine.\nWhen you review your deployment, this is fine.\nWhen you implement, deploy and administrate, however, you just have to trust your previous considerations.\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Thursday, 25th September, 2025","title":"The Bitter Feeling of Technial Compromises","description":" My very personal troubles dealing with compromises, explained at an example of docker_cron with Renovate.\nSometimes you really don't have to worry as much and trust your previous, careful considerations.
