you are a user, developer or simply interested in a healthy society, you benefit from Open-Source and we should fight for every bit of it.\nOpen-Source is a quality mark, a form of democracy and ownership, capitalism at its best and thus the response to this world, a world in which software exists.\nThis article gets to that conclusion without requiring any prior technical knowledge.\n\n## Background\nNevertheless, you'll need the following concepts, which I'll explain below: *hardware*, *software*, *executable*, *compilation*, *source code* and *software license*.\nFirstly, I'll start with an example, your laptop:\nThe thing you can hold in your hand is *hardware*, the text editor you use on it is *software*.\nTo use this text editor you need to give your laptop an *executable*.\nThe developer of that text editor wrote *source code* and converted (i.e., *compiled*) that into the executable.\n\n<HalfImage src={eniac} />\n\nWith this example in mind, enjoy the general explanation:\nFor centuries we humans have been hard at work creating technology.\nFor most of that history, technology has been pieces of physical machinery designed to fulfil a specific purpose.\nThis is *hardware*, something you can touch.\nNow at some time smart people created hardware that didn't just fulfil any single specific purpose.\nThey invented the general purpose computer (the image on the right or above), a machine that executes an *executable*.\nAn executable instructs the computer exactly what to do and is a form of *software*.\nYour laptop is such a general purpose computer — a joker card that performs different specific purposes depending on what software you execute on it.\nYou can't touch software, you can only touch the hardware you feed the software into.\n\nThough an executable is an abstract piece of data, you can represent it using `0` and `1` characters.\nThis is such a truncated representation of an example executable:\n```\n01111111 01000101 01001100 01000110 00000010 00000001\n00000001 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011 00000000\n00111110 00000000 00000001 00000000 00000000 00000000\n01010000 00010000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n00000000 00000000 01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 10010000 00110110\n00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 01000000 00000000\n00111000 00000000 00001110 00000000 01000000 00000000\n00011111 00000000 00011110 00000000 00000110 00000000\n00000000 00000000 00000100 00000000 00000000 00000000\n01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n00000000 00000000 01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 01000000 00000000\n00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n...\n```\nYou won't understand any of this, in fact no-one will.\nIf, instead, you give it to a computer, it will execute this executable and perform the action defined in it.\nIn this example's case, the computer would simply say `Hello World!`.\nAs you hopefully notice, even if I gave you the entire executable, you can't simply figure out what the executable does.\nFor all intents and purposes you can think of an executable as a black-box that does something but doesn't let you know how.\n\nThis executable is pretty obnoxious to even look at.\nSo you might wonder how you create this executable in the first place.\nNowadays you don't do so directly, but write source code instead.\nJust like an executable, source code is a form of software, too.\nHere is the source code that belongs to the executable you've already seen above:\n```c\n#include <printf.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Hello World!\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIn contrast to the executable from before, you can already make sense of this.\nFor example, you can see the text `Hello World!` in there.\nYou could probably figure out how to modify this software so that is says `Hello Anna!` instead, right?\nSource code is understandable and editable by humans.\nThe developer uses a tool called the *compiler* to compile her source code into an executable.\n\nRemember the differences between source code and executable as they are crucial for this article:\n- The user needs only an executable to use a piece of software.\n- A human cannot understand or edit an executable.\n- However, a human can very well understand and edit source code.\n- The compiler easily converts source code into an executable.\n- On the other hand, you cannot convert an executable back into its source code.\n\n### Software License and Open-Source\n(This is no legal advice.)\nSource code falls under the law of copyright:\nBecause the developer wrote the source code, she can decide what to do with it.\nOf course, the developer gives the user an executable.\nHowever, she might not allow the user to do whatever he wants with her software.\nFor example, he might not be allowed to sell the software himself.\nThe developer lays out conditions in a legal document called the *software license*, which the user must accept.\nThere are different kinds of such licenses.\nIn this article we are concerned about *Open-Source licenses*.\nAn Open-Source license makes a software Open-Source.\nTechnically, there are multiple different Open-Source licenses.\nThe Open Source Initiative (OSI) keeps a list of OSI approved licenses that fulfil the [definition of Open-Source](https://opensource.org/osd).\nTo me, the most important aspects of Open-Source software are:\n\n1. Everyone has free access to the source code.\n2. Everyone may modify the software.\n3. Everyone is allowed to sell and redistribute the (modified) software, both as an executable and as source code.\n\nNote how this does not mean that the executable must be free, too.\nIt also doesn't mean the developers waives her copyright.\nActually, she still very much has the copyright and, within the definition of Open-Source, may define restrictions on using the software.\nFor example, some Open-Source licenses require you to publish any modified source code under the same license.\nSuch licenses (e.g., GPLv3) are *copyleft* licenses.\nOthers, like the MIT license, don't have such a copyleft clause.\nSo while the concept of Open-Source might sound radical to some, it leaves a surprising amount of power to the software developer.\nThis will become important when we talk about one of the main issues with Open-Source: [monetization](#how-do-you-monetize-open-source-software).\n\n*Closed-Source*, as you might imagine, is the opposite of Open-Source.\nClosed-Source software generally doesn't allow the user to see the source code.\nAs stated above, you need the source code to understand and modify the software.\nWithout the source code, the user isn't able to do any of that.\n\n## The User of Open/Closed-Source\nOkay, this has been all long and windy.\nLet's get to the point:\nSay you want to write a document with your laptop.\nYou already have the hardware and are missing the software.\nWhat you need is a text editing program, something like LibreOffice Writer or Word.\nYou choose one of them, pay the manufacturer and receive an executable.\nYour laptop feeds on the executable, you can write your document and everything is well.\nWord is a Closed-Source product by Microsoft.\nLibreOffice Writer is an Open-Source product by the Document Foundation.\nNow, what does that mean to you, the user?\n\nSay you bought Word 2019.\nThen you only receive the executable and no more.\nYou have no insight into how the thing you bought works because Microsoft keeps the source code secret.\nThere's no way of modifying the product you bought in any way.\nOnly Microsoft can change Word.<br />\nWhat if you got Open-Source LibreOffice Writer instead?\nYou receive not just the executable, with which you can write your document, no.\nInstead, you and everyone else has access to its source code, too.\nThis is the form of LibreOffice Writer in which the (original) programmers modify it.\nTherefore, you can look into LibreOffice Writer and make sense of all its functions.\nPerhaps you're interested in what happens to your document when you hit `Ctrl+S` and save your document.\nMaybe you're concerned about who might read your <del>smut</del>confidential information.\nThen you can just take a look at the source code and see exactly what happens to your data.\nNothing is hidden from you, because Open-Source means **Insight**.\n\nOr, if there's a button in the user interface you're specifically interested in, you can look at the source code that belongs to that button.\nYou can figure out exactly what that button does and how.\nPerhaps you have some very specific use-case.\nMaybe you're color blind and want to change the color of the button.\nThen you can implement that change yourself, because Open-Source means **Modifiability**.\n\nLet's come back to what happens when you `Ctrl+S` your document.\nSome versions of Word suddenly started sending the document to a Microsoft server per default.\nData on such a server can be accessed by, among others, Microsoft personnel and the government the data resides in.\nThat is probably not the country you're living in, btw.<br />\nThe Open-Source LibreOffice Writer doesn't suddenly start doing that.\nAfter all you and everyone else is reading the source code so you'd notice a change like this.\nAnd even if such a change did happen, you could change the source code back.\nThere are so many companies trying to sell their product under the name of privacy.\nThe companies that truly deliver on that create Open-Source software, because Open-Source means **Privacy**.\n\nWhat's more, you probably don't just want to write documents but also read some written by other people.\nWhen you download a document from the internet and open it in Word or LibreOffice Writer you might get hacked!\nOkay, how's that?\nWell, software is never perfect.\nDevelopers make mistakes and some of these mistakes allow people to create documents that hack you, to e.g., steal your banking login.\nSuch mistakes are called *vulnerabilities* and they are, obviously, bad.\nWhat you need is *security support*, which is someone hunting for vulnerabilities and fixing them.\nIn the case of Word, Microsoft provides that service.\nWhenever they find a vulnerability they remove it and release a new executable.\nNo one else can do that because only Microsoft has access to the source code.\nBut if you're using Word 2019 you're out of luck:\nMicrosoft stops supporting Word 2019 after 14th October 2025.\nThey recommend you to use Microsoft 365 instead for a monthly fee.<br />\nBecause LibreOffice Writer is Open-Source, heaps of people read through its source code all the time, search for vulnerabilities and publish fixes.\nFurthermore, any company with the technical abilities can provide support — not just the original manufacturer.\nThis most dearly matters to security critical applications like telecommunication encryption.\nTetra, for example, is a Closed-Source method of encrypted radio communication.\nUnfortunately because it's source code is kept secret, very few people ever looked at it.\nTherefore, it is ungodly insecure and has been [hacked](https://www.midnightblue.nl/research/tetraburst) many times in colorfully different ways.\nToo bad, a lot of police and military use it.\nTLS, on the other hand, is an Open-Source encryption software and powers most of the internet.\nConsequently, incredibly many people comb through its source code.\nHence, it is one of the most secure encryption methods in existence, because Open-Source means **Security**.\n\nThere's one more important aspect to the debate: Interoperability.\nLibreOffice Writer stores documents in the Open-Source OpenDocument format by default.\nThis format is supported by dozens of text editor, including LibreOffice Writer and Word.\nBecause it is Open-Source, those other manufacturers know how to make their software understand this format.\nTherefore, when you've written a bunch of documents in LibreOffice Writer, you can switch to any other text editor whenever you like.\nAfter all, you can easily open your documents with that new software, too.<br />\nThis is a different story with Word.\nWord only fully supports a Closed-Source document format.\nNo other text editor fully supports that file format.\nThough there are some ways of converting Word documents to the OpenDocument format, that process does not support all features (e.g., text might be misaligned).\nThis is called *vendor lock-in*:\nThe vendor, i.e., Microsoft, locks you into using Word because switching is harder than it should be.\nWhen you use Open-Source software, on the other hand, you can easily switch to a competitor — even back to a Closed-Source one.\nOpen-Source means **Autonomy**.\n\nThere's another facet of this autonomy:\nMicrosoft doesn't just sell Word.\nThey also want to sell the operating system Windows, OneDrive and a bunch of other software.\nThey disallow using Word in conjunction with competitors to the software they also want to sell.\nFor example, you may not use the Word executable on a laptop using the Linux operating system.\nIf Word were Open-Source, people could enable support for other operating systems.\nClosed-Source means being locket into not just one software, but a manufacturer's entire ecosystem.\n\nTo me, these are the main selling points of Open-Source for a user:\n\n- **Insight**: the software doesn't hide anything from you.\n- **Modifiability**: you can change whatever you want about the software.\n- **Privacy**: you know and control what the software does with your data.\n- **Security**: the software doesn't allow other people to hack you.\n- **Autonomy**: you are free to choose what software you use.\n\nAs you can see there is a lot of \"you\" in that list.\nPersonally, that's why Open-Source gives me a sense of ownership that I can't get any other way.\nWe'll get back to this point, though.\nFirst let me address a few counterpoints.\n\n### But I Don't Want / Know How to Touch Source Code.\nThat's perfectly fine.\nBut trust me, there are plenty of people who do.\nActually, there are entire communities of people looking at Open-Source source code and improving it.\nAnd Open-Source software benefits from that — you benefit from that.\nBecause everyone can read the source code of Open-Source software, you can pay everyone with the technical abilities to implement whatever specific feature you need.\nThis is what the [Austrian military](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2025/09/30/austrias-military-switches-from-microsoft-office-to-libreoffice) did.\nThey needed certain features in LibreOffice and contracted a local company to do so.\nIt is very important to them, and to me, to clarify that Open-Source does not mean cheap, it means *free* as in *free*dom.\nThe Austrian military very much cares for the data they handle and mainly seek the privacy LibreOffice Writer provides.\nThat's why they chose Open-Source.\n\n### So you're just Bashing Word and Microsoft?\nNo, I don't, not at all!\nI'm only using LibreOffice Writer and Word as an example for a bigger concept.\nAll of the above points apply to Open-Source in general.\nAlso, Microsoft is no more or less evil than any other corporation.\nThey actually do work on some Open-Source software, too.\nAnd I think that's pretty cool!\n\n### Why wasn't Closed-Source a Problem Back in the Day?\n<HalfImage src={chrisw_typewriter} />\n\nLet's buy a typewriter (picture by [Christoph Wolf](https://teccheck.xyz))!\nSure, you can write your document with it but there's more.\nOpen it up; just pop off the metal panels and you get a good look at its internals.\nPerhaps all the metallic pieces don't make much sense at first but you can still look at them.\nYou bought this view alongside the typewriter.\nYou bought the ability to understand the typewriter.\nThese two things are linked together in a way software just isn't.\nTo understand software you need more than just the executable required for using it, you need the source code.\nFrom this perspective, the old way of technology is much closer to Open-source than to Closed-Source.\nHowever, if the manufacturer switched from mechanical typewriters to software and kept giving the user only the minimum to write a document, you end up with Closed-Source software like Word.\nThat's a loss.\nI argue, Open-Source is the **response to a world in which software exists**.\n\n<HalfImage src={chrisw_typewriter_open} />\n\nLet me spin this along a little more:\nPress a key on the typewriter and follow the mechanism producing some ink on the page.\nYou follow the ribbon unspooling on the left, getting hit by the hammer and collecting on the other spool.\nOn some typewriters you can still see the typed letters on the ink ribbon.\nMaybe you've written something confidential and that's a security concern for you.\nBecause the typewriter is not a black-box like Word is, you can look inside and realize that yourself.\nNow, go dispose of your spent ribbon responsibly.\n\nI'm only using this typewriter as an example but I believe the problem to be fundamental.\nTheoretical computer science tells us that software is inherently difficult to reason about.\nEven the original developers of software can't foresee most of what the software will do.\nActually, that's one of the reasons there are so many vulnerabilities in software.\nConsequently, with the arrival of software, we need more curious people than ever.\nAnd those curious people need a chance at understanding the technology surrounding us.\nThis is the only way we can tame this beast.\nWe cannot delegate that understanding to a few select people and treat technology as black-boxes; we all need to participate in some way.\nOpen-Source is the way that is possible.\nWhen you're surrounded with Open-Source software you are invited, encouraged, to interact with the world more intimately.\nYou realize that *you* are the one to understand, change and improve.\nThis results in an inherently more secure world.\nWhen, instead, something is Closed-Source that means the manufacturer doesn't want you, the customer, to understand the product.\nIt means they don't see the potential in you or even fear it.\nSo much is lost when we just wait for others to do things.\nAlso, in a more poetic way, we are a species of curious animals.\nWhat life is this when we all walk among devices we can't touch or open or tinker with?\nTherefore, I consider Open-Source a form of **enlightenment**.\n\n### So I've Changed some Source Code. What do I Do With It?\nSay you implemented a new feature to the source code of LibreOffice Writer.\nVery cool!\nWhat do you do with this feature?\nThere are two options:\n\n1. *Upstreaming* it.\n2. Creating a *fork*.\n\nFirstly you can go to the original LibreOffice Writer developers and offer them the features you have made.\nThey then discuss your changes and, if they like them, *upstream* them.\nIf that happens, your new feature will be in all new versions of LibreOffice Writer.\nThis is the best-case scenario, because you aren't the only user of your new feature.\nThose other users might improve your new feature further.\nYou, of course, benefit from that.<br />\nWhat if the LibreOffice Writer developers refuse to upstream your feature, however?\nThen you can use the second option and create your own version of LibreOffice Writer.\nThis would be a *fork* of LibreOffice Writer.\nNow it's up to the users to choose which version of LibreOffice Writer they want to use: the original or your fork?\nThis is actually very common in Open-Source.\nPeople come up with all sorts of crazy ideas that are sometimes so radical, the original developers don't want to upstream them.\nLibreOffice Writer itself is actually a fork of OpenOffice Writer, btw.\n(And OpenOffice Writer is a fork of StarOffice Writer.)\nThe LibreOffice Writer developers implemented such cool new features they gathered so many people around them, they dwarfed the older OpenOffice and StarOffice Writer.\n\nIn contrast to Closed-Source software, there isn't just a single corporation deciding how things should be.\nThe power lies with the people.\nEveryone with the technical abilities or is just curious enough can incur change.\nTherefore, I consider Open-Source a form of **democracy**.\n\n### But isn't Open-Source Incompatible with Capitalism?\nSome might argue that Open-Source doesn't work well with capitalism.\nThey argue capitalism works so well because of all the competition.\nSay, three companies develop software for the same purpose and fight for the user's favor.\nIf one of these products is Open-Source, the other two companies could simply copy that software and sell it, too.\nThen the other two companies didn't have to develop their own software and there'd only be a single piece of software, not three.\nWhere's the competition?\n\nFirstly, they are completely right, capitalism is quite the efficient machine and competition lies at its heart.\nSecondly, we'll talk about how to monetize Open-Source software [later](#how-do-you-monetize-open-source-software).\nThirdly, that conclusion is wrong.\nOpen-Source does not lead to less competition; it leads to more.\nFirstly, if you've read the [section above](#so-ive-changed-some-source-code-what-do-i-do-with-it) about forks you know how they compete for users.\nThere always are different ways of solving the same problem and the different forks reflect that.\nActually, the bigger problem in Open-Source is fragmentation where there is too much competition.\nWhile I won't get into that in this article, rest assured, there are ways of dealing with fragmentation, too.\n\nThink of the main reason Word is in use.\nIs its interface easier to use or is it cheaper than the competition?\nNo, the main reason is that there already are so many documents written in Word's Closed-Source file format.\nBecause of that, people aren't able to easily use anything else.\nThat doesn't sound much like competition, does it?\nClosed-Source is the real culprit here.\nAs discussed [above](#the-user-of-openclosed-source) Closed-Source tends to lock users into a single manufacturer's products.\nIn order for real competition to exist, users must be able to choose what restaurant they go to, what brand of toilet paper they buy.\nAnd, of course, users must be able to easily choose what software they use.\nThe autonomy Open-Source provides enables that.\nHence, Open-Source is **capitalism at its best**.\n\n## The Developer of Open/Closed-Source\nSay you want to create a text editor yourself for some reason.\nIf you choose to make your software Open-Source, you don't have to develop the entire software yourself.\nInstead, you can take LibreOffice Writer and use it as a basis for your idea of what a text editor should be.\nThis is a lot easier than starting from scratch and having to reinvent the wheel.\nFor you, personally, this has another facet when you're changing companies.\nMake your work Open-Source and you never have to implement it again.\nOpen-Source is not an act of charity, it simply makes you **not repeat yourself**.\n\nI've already talked about the sheer amount of text editors that support the OpenDocument file format.\nYou know how that came to be?\nWell, the developers of StarOffice Writer developed that file format and made it Open-Source.\nThen other people developing text editors simply used that file format.\nWhy develop a new standard, when there already is one you're free to use?\nAnd that, in turn, benefited the developers of StarOffice because users of their file format can do more with it.\nThere, actually, are a lot of Open-Source standards.\nSo when you create an Open-Source product you might **establish a standard**.\n\nOf course there's another point to this:\nWhen you're keeping your software Closed-Source no one can see the crimes you've committed in the code.\nIf, however, you create Open-Source software, that means you're so proud of your source code, you want people to look at it.\nTherefore, Open-Source is a form of **advertisement**.\n\nTo me, these are the main selling points of Open-Source for a developer:\n\n- **Don't repeat yourself**, never have to implement something twice in your life.\n- **Establish a standard** and thus an ecosystem around your product.\n- **Advertise** yourself and your products.\n\n### How do you Monetize Open-Source software?\nMonetizing Closed-Source software is pretty straight-forward; you just sell the executable.\nThere's no one else who can do that.\nSome might argue that companies need to keep their source code a trade secret to remain competitive.\nOtherwise, other companies could just copy the source code and sell it themselves, driving you out of business.\nI'll quickly go over a few ways you can monetize Open-Source, regardless of that threat.\n\nFirstly, consider that **providing support** isn't easy.\nYou need both the source code and the technical expertise specific to the software in question.\nGuess who is best qualified for that?\nOf course, the programmers who originally developed the software; that's you.\nSome companies make that their business model and sell support for their Open-Source software.<br />\nThen there's another thing that isn't easy: **compilation and distribution**.\nThe Open-Source Android app DAVx⁵, for example, uses this approach.\nIf the user wants to easily install this app, they have to pay on the Google Play Store.\nInstead, they could download the source code for free and compile an executable themselves.\nBut most users want the ease of simply hitting a download button and thus pay for that.\nDAVx⁵ provides you with an up-to-date version of the executable.\nThe definition of Open-Source might force them to publish the source code but they are very well allowed to keep the executable secret.<br />\nOr, maybe your Open-Source software goes nicely with some **hardware** you produce.\nThen you can sell that.<br />\nOr, instead, you take your product and make most of it Open-Source and some secret sauce **Closed-Source**.\nThen you can sell that and still get most of the benefits of Open-Source (though some people frown upon that approach).<br />\nAlternatively you can use the Open-Source software to establish a standard and then write some Closed-Source software for that standard.\nYou're the one who understands the standard the best, after all.<br />\nOr, if you want to remain fully Open-Source, you can always **implement other people's feature requests** for some coin.\n\nThose options, while they are not exhaustive, are all possible and done by players in the industry \nYou're free to mix and match them however you like and, of course, always just ask for **donations**.\nSometimes that already suffices.\nWrapping this up, know that Open-Source requires a different business model than Closed-Source.\nBut notice that there is a business model for this and your developers and customers benefit hugely from your product being Open-Source.\n\n## Conclusion\nI won't hide my love for Open-Source.\nI love it so much it aches whenever I'm not allowed to work with it.\nSomehow I never got to sort my reasons for that feeling.\nThis article has been my attempt at doing just that.\nWe've seen why users benefit from Open-Source software.\nThen we found those benefits to be vital in Open-Source's bigger role in society.\nLastly, we put on the shoes of a developer and found Open-Source to have many benefits here, too.\nAfter all this, there are a few points I want to stress:\n\n- Open-Source is no charity, though it can be.\n- Open-Source does not mean *for free* or cheap.\n- Open-Source also isn't a utopia.\n  It's a world that already very much exists and we can have more of.\n  Every little piece of Open-Source software makes the world a better place.\n\nI hope you understand why I love Open-Source so much.\nTo me, the ownership aspect is the most important.\nNo one can take my way of experiencing an Open-Source product away from me.\nI really want to own what I bought and that simply isn't possible with Closed-Source software.\nAlso, I just love this world.\nIt's a world in which you are invited to be curious, in which more and more people understand the technology they use.\nIt warms my heart to see that world being as huge as it already is and only seeing it grow.\n\n### P.S.\nI've simplified a few things:\n\n- You actually can take a closer look at an executable and undo the compilation.\n  This process of converting an executable back into source code is called *reverse-engineering*.\n  It is often incredibly tedious and unfeasible.\n- Technically not all programming languages produce executables.\n  Though, the characteristics laid out in this article capture those compilation results, too.\n  I just used *executable* as an example for a bigger concept.\n- There are more flavours of Open-Source.\n  For example there's Open-Hardware and Open-Data.\n  In some places I called things Open-Source that are actually Open-Data.\n  But the characteristics I described apply to all.\n\n### P.P.S.\nSo I was looking to get my hand on an actual typewriter and searched for \"Stuttgart Schreibmaschine\".\nThe first result was an official wiki on the matter of [how to properly discard a typewriter](https://www.stuttgart.de/service/entsorgung/abfall-abc/abfall-abc/schreibmaschine).\nHow German, I suppose...<br />\nInstead, [Christoph Wolf](https://teccheck.xyz) helped out, tracked down a typewriter and took a few pictures for me.\nHe even typed down this article's introduction on it, how cute!\n<HalfImage src={chrisw_typewriter_article} full={true}/>\n","frontmatter":{"date":"Saturday, 11th October, 2025","title":"Why I love Open-Source","description":" We all live in a world of immensely complex technology. The concept of Open-Source might seem radical at first but it's indispensable in our world.
