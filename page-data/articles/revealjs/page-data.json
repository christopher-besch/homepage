resource_loading from \"./resource_loading.png\";\n\n[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) is an open source HTML presentation framework.\nIt's recommended to those with a heart for programmatic approaches and web technologies.\nI started using it to replace PowerPoint.\nThis article sums up my experiences, shows how the most important tasks can be achieved and then explains my custom method of using reveal.js.\nIf you're interested in bash, it also explains the automation scripts used.\n\n### Table of Contents\n{\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-revealjs\">What is

the blue arrows in the bottom right corner to jump between slides.\nIf you're using a vertical mobile device, consider turning it and reading this article in landscape mode&mdash;presentations aren't held on TikTok after all.\nTo enter fullscreen you have to use a PC, click on the presentation and press `F` (`Esc` to exit).\nThis presenter behaves how a PowerPoint user would expect it.\n\nThe creation of such a presentation however isn't anything like PowerPoint.\nEverything that is shown is defined in an `index.html` file, the complete structure of which will be described [later on](#template).\nWhat follows are the individual elements forming the presentation.\n\n## Slides and Vertical Slides\nYou create slides inside the `<div class=\"slides\">` environment with one `<section>` tag each.\nIf you insert another `<section>` tag within this, you've created a vertical slide.\nThe default transition between horizontal slides is a horizontal swipe, while vertical slides swap places with a vertical movement.\n\nHere is an example, where ellipsis (`...`) indicate omitted parts:\n```html\n<div class=\"slides\">\n    ...\n    <section>\n        Horizontal Slide\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <section>\n            Vertical Slide 1\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            Vertical Slide 2\n        </section>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <section>\n            Only using a single vertical slide is also fine;<br />\n            this has the same effect as a plain horizontal slide\n        </section>\n    </section>\n    ...\n</div>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/1\" fullscreen />\n\nI never use plain horizontal slides.\nInstead I use the outer `<section>` tags to group multiple vertical slides into logical units.\nWhen there's a horizontal swipe, the viewer knows that I start talking about a new subtopic.\n\nPress `Esc` while you're **not** in fullscreen and on PC.\nNow you see the slide overview and you should be able to make out the individual horizontal slides as columns.\nThis overview serves as a quick access menu if you want to jump to a different slide without mashing your poor keyboard.\n\nFrom this point on, I for simplicity won't always show the outer `<section>` tag in the code examples.\n\n## Headings and Lists\nSince reaveal.js is an HTML framework, you may let all your WebDev skills shine.\nIf you've never worked with any web technologies, reveal.js is a great way of getting started.\nThat also means that if e.g. you need lists with numbers, you can google `HTML numbered list`;\nthese features aren't limited to reveal.js.\n\nYou can use the `<h1>` tag for headings; `<h2>`, `<h3>` and so on are subheadings and subsubheadings.\nLists can be created with the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags as shown below.\n```html\n<section>\n    <h1>This is a heading</h1>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n    <h2>This is a subheading</h2>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n    <ul>\n        <li>First Element</li>\n        <li>Second Element</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/4\" fullscreen />\n\n## Horizontal Partitioning\nI use the custom class `half-part` to horizontally split the slide in two parts.\n```html\n<div class=\"half-part\">\n    <h3>\n        The Rearing of Stones\n    </h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Stones only multiple in specific aqueous environments</li>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Aquarium (space to swim)</li>\n            <li>Oxygen supply (asphyxiation is no fun)</li>\n            <li>Ambient light, preferably candles (for the right multiplying-mood)</li>\n        </ul>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"half-part\">\n    <img src=\"./stones.jpg\">\n    <ul>\n        <li>This is no legal advice</li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/5\" fullscreen />\n\n`half-part` class is defined in [theme/template/custom_styles.scss](https://github.com/christopher-besch/presentations/blob/main/theme/template/custom_styles.scss).\nThe build system compiling SCSS to CSS I used is described [below](#installing-and-compiling-like-me).\nBut feel free to simply add the code to a `style.css` file and import it like this in HTML:\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./style.css\">\n```\n\n## LaTeX\nThere are many different ways of rendering LaTeX equations with reveal.js.\nI chose to use KaTeX, which is loaded via a plugin (check out [the template section](#template)).\nIt allows me to write equations wherever I want within a `$LaTeX math environment$`.\nIf you need multiple lines, use the `aligned` environment.\n\nMore complex LaTeX structures, e.g. utilizing TikZ, have to be precompiled into an image with transparent background.\nThis article is already nerdy enough so check out [2022_03_14_neue_formeln_messunsicherheiten/stromwaage.tex](https://github.com/christopher-besch/presentations/blob/main/2022_03_14_neue_formeln_messunsicherheiten/stromwaage.tex) if you're interested.\n```html\n<p>\n    This $F = m \\cdot a$ was an inline equation.\n</p>\n<br />\n\n<p>\n    Some bigger equation:\n    \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    E &= m \\cdot c^2 \\\\\n    h \\cdot f &= E\n    \\end{aligned}\\]\n</p>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/6\" fullscreen />\n\nThe `<p>` tag creates a paragraph and the `<br / >` a newline.\n\n## Quotes\n```html\n<blockquote>\n    \"Single thread performance [increase] stopped, because we were starting to fry eggs on the chips [...].\"\n    <br />\n    <span style=\"float: right;\">â€”Bjarne Stroustrup</span>\n</blockquote>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/7\" fullscreen />\n\n## Code Blocks\nI'm using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) for code highlighting.\nIt can again be loaded through a plugin (see [the template section](#template) for more).\nThe actual code get's loaded from a separate file (`code.cpp`) using the [external_code](https://github.com/dafrenchyman/reveal.js-extrernal-code) plugin.\n```html\nA little bit of code\n<pre>\n    <code class=\"language-cpp\" data-code=\"./code.cpp\">\n    </code>\n</pre>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/8\" fullscreen />\n\n## Animations\nThere are two main ways of animating elements:\n- **Auto-Animate** and\n- **Fragments**.\n\n### Auto-Animate\nAuto-Animate works by transitioning between two similar slides, which are denoted by the `data-auto-animate` attribute.\n`data-auto-animate-restart` separates different consecutive animations.\nEvery element that exists in both slides should have the same `data-id` attribute;\nthen reveal.js smoothly transitions between them.\nWith this you can cleanly add new or change already existent content.\nWhen you not only change the content of a tag but also the type of tag you use, you have to contain the changing tag in a wrapper-div as shown in the example below.\n\nYou can find more information in [the official documentation](https://revealjs.com/auto-animate).\n```html\n<!-- transitioning with same content -->\n<section data-auto-animate>\n    <h1 data-id=\"hello\">Hello</h1>\n</section>\n<section data-auto-animate>\n    <h1 data-id=\"hello\">Hello</h1>\n    <h1>World</h1>\n</section>\n\n<!-- transitioning between different tags -->\n<!-- -> transitioning between wrappers with different content -->\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-restart>\n    <div data-id=\"hello_wrapper\">\n        <h1>h1 Heading</h1>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section data-auto-animate>\n    <div data-id=\"hello_wrapper\">\n        <h4>h4 Heading</h4>\n    </div>\n</section>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/9\" fullscreen />\n\n### Fragments\nThe main problem with auto-animate is code duplication:\nWhen you add a new tag you still need to redefine your old tags over and over again.\nTherefore I prefer fragments wherever possible.\n\nWhen parts of your slide should be revealed bit by bit, assign them the `fragment` class.\nIf you need a different order in which to reveal the fragments, use the `data-fragment-index` attribute as shown in the second example.\n```html\n<section>\n    <ul>\n        <li>I</li>\n        <li class=\"fragment\">Like</li>\n        <li class=\"fragment\">Cheese.</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">I</li>\n        <li class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\">Like</li>\n        <li>Cheese.</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/10\" fullscreen />\n\n## Title Page\nAt this point you might be wondering how I'm defining the left and right headers on each slide.\nThey are custom and heavily inspired by [Benjamin Hackl](https://benjamin-hackl.at)'s reveal.js presentations.\nAnd when you're already at it, check out [Benjamin's presentations](https://benjamin-hackl.at/talks);\nthey inspired me to try out reveal.js in the first place.\n\nTake another look at the very beginning of the example presentation:\n```html\n<div class=\"slides\">\n    <div class=\"header-left\">\n        This is <b>reveal.js</b>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"header-right\">\n        <em>Chris</em> &bullet; 24<sup>th</sup> June 2022\n    </div>\n\n    <section>\n        <section data-state=\"titleslide\" data-auto-animate>\n            <h1>\n                This is <b>reveal.js</b>\n            </h1>\n        </section>\n        <section data-state=\"titleslide\" data-auto-animate>\n            <h1>\n                This is <b>reveal.js</b>\n            </h1>\n            <h4>\n                More precisely: <b>my</b> way of using it\n            </h4>\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n            You're viewing the third slide.<br />\n            This example presentation accompanies <a href=\"https://chris-besch.com/articles/revealjs\">the\n                article</a>.<br />\n            Feel free to take a look; each feature will be explained below.\n        </section>\n    </section>\n    ...\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/\" fullscreen />\n\nContrary to Benjamin Hackl's version, these headers are defined within the `div class=\"slides\">` environment, right before the first slide.\nThis makes the headers scale correctly with different screen resolutions.\nThe title section(s) should contain the `data-state=\"titleslide\"` attribute;\nthese slides won't show the left header.\nNow you can prettily place the title on the first slide and then move it to the top left, so that any laggards joining your audience late know which presentations they are interrupting.\n\nThe source code defining the `header-left` and `header-right` classes can again be found in [theme/template/custom_styles.scss](https://github.com/christopher-besch/presentations/blob/main/theme/template/custom_styles.scss).\n\n## Backgrounds\n\nAll the different options you have for backgrounds can be found in [the official documentation](https://revealjs.com/backgrounds).\nThis is only a little sneak peek of what can be done.\n```html\n<section data-auto-animate>\n    <p id=\"more_things\">There are many things reveal.js can use as backgrounds.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section data-background-video=\"./illusion.mp4\" data-background-video-loop data-background-opacity=\"0.2\"\n    data-auto-animate>\n    <p id=\"more_things\">There are many things reveal.js can use as backgrounds.</p>\n    <p>\n        Like videos showing off what\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/Kiran-Raj-Dev\">Kiran</a> can do\n        with <a href=\"https://www.manim.community\">Manim</a>.\n    </p>\n</section>\n\n<section data-background-iframe=\"https://chris-besch.com\" data-background-opacity=\"0.2\">\n    Or an Iframe taking your wherever you please.<br />\n    (Click on this text to unfocus the Iframe again.)\n</section>\n\n<section data-background-image=\"./duck.jpg\" data-background-opacity=\"0.3\">\n    Maybe even the beautiful picture of a duck,<br />\n    taken by an even more beautiful photographer.\n</section>\n```\n<Iframe present=\"2022_06_24_reveal_example/#/11\" fullscreen />\n\n# Template\nTo quickly get started you can use [my template](https://github.com/christopher-besch/presentations/blob/main/template/index.html).\nI'll keep it updated with any necessary future fixes.\nFeel free to delete the copyright notice in the top;\nyour presentation belongs under **your** copyright, not mine.\nI'd be glad if you could give this article credit but I don't require you to.\n\nThere are a few more features that didn't make it in this article.\nTake a look at [my presentations](https://present.chris-besch.com) and [their source code](https://github.com/christopher-besch/presentations) for some inspiration.\nThis also includes the example presentation used in this very article.\n\nYou should notice that there is a light mode as well.\nActually there are [many different themes](https://revealjs.com/themes) you can use&mdash;there never is just black and white.\n\nThe next few paragraphs explain what else you need to make a reveal.js presentation work.\n\n# Installing and Compiling Like Me\nWhen I went to the installation page on [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com) I found the recommended method to not suit my taste in the slightest.\nYou are expected to clone the reveal.js repository, replace the provided example presentation with you own, compile and call it a day.\nWhen you have multiple presentations you have to store the reveal.js source code multiple times and when you intend to use Git for version control, you have to create a fork of the reveal.js repo over and over again.\nWhile searching for a workaround, I realized that the `index.html` file isn't actually part of the compilation step.\nThis means that you can compile the reveal.js resources once and use them in multiple presentations;\nthe compiled reveal.js resources are independent of the individual presentations.\n\n<HalfImage src={resource_loading} />\n\nAdditionally I need high reliability&mdash;\nwhen you're standing in front of an audience, your presentation **has** to work.\nA necessity for this is the ability to present without an active internet connection.\nIf you're hosting your presentation locally, this might sound simple enough.\nBut it get's more complicated when you realize just how many typical web solutions load resources from content delivery networks (CDNs).\nThese CDNs might not be reachable at all time and are a big privacy concern.\nTherefore I don't accept anything that doesn't get loaded from my own site.\nThis mostly concerns the plugins I need.\n\nSo I created a *slightly* different way of using reveal.js:\nI'm using a single [Git repository](https://github.com/christopher-besch/presentations) for all my presentations, each in their own directory.\nThey have access to reveal.js, my custom themes, whatever plugins I consider useful and other static resources.\nA custom build script `build.sh` puts everything needed for hosting the presentations in the `public` directory.\n\n<Spacer />\n\n## Build Script\n\nThis section explains in detail what the `build.sh` script needs to do in order for my way of using reveal.js to work.\nIt is written for those who are already somewhat familiar with bash scripting and [reveal.js's build process](https://revealjs.com/installation/#full-setup).\n\nFirst of all it clones reveal.js into the build directory `reveal`, which isn't being tracked by Git (excluded via `.gitignore`).\nAfter which it checks out a specific version of reveal.js.\n```bash\necho \"cloning reveal.js...\"\ngit clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js reveal || true\n# change directory\npushd reveal\ngit checkout 4.3.1\n```\n\nSince I use custom themes, I copy them from the `theme` into the `reveal/css/theme/source` and `reveal/css/theme/template` directories.\n```bash\necho \"installing custom themes...\"\ncp -v ../theme/source/* ./css/theme/source\ncp -v ../theme/template/* ./css/theme/template\n```\n\nNow the `reveal` directory contains everything required to compile reveal.js just like [normal](https://revealjs.com/installation/#full-setup).\n```bash\necho \"installing yarn dependencies...\"\nrm -v package-lock.json || true\nyarn install\n\necho \"building reveal.js...\"\nyarn run build\npopd\n```\n\nThe `reveal/dist` and `reveal/plugin` directories contain all output files and get copied into the `public` folder.\n```bash\necho \"creating public dir...\"\nrm -rv public || true\nmkdir -v public\n\necho \"copying reveal output files...\"\ncp -rv reveal/{dist,plugin} public\n```\n\nThis is also a good time to copy any static files; for example code highlighting themes.\n```bash\necho \"copying static files\"\ncp -vr static public/static\n```\n\n### Plugins\nThe `vendor` directory contains a few submodules, other git repositories (checked out at a specific commit) contained in a subdirectory.\nThese are plugins for reveal.js.\n```bash\necho \"copying vendor dependencies...\"\ncp -rv vendor public/vendor\n```\n\nSome plugins are precompiled and can't be loaded using submodules.\nThese plugins need to be downloaded and extracted by the build script.\n```bash\necho \"downloading precompiled dependencies...\"\nrm -rfv public/dwn_vendor\nmkdir public/dwn_vendor\nwget https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases/download/v0.15.3/katex.tar.gz -O public/dwn_vendor/katex.tar.gz\n\necho \"extracting precompiled dependencies...\"\npushd public/dwn_vendor\ntar xfv katex.tar.gz\nrm -v katex.tar.gz\n# katex needs weird dist directory\nmv katex temp\nmkdir katex\nmv temp katex/dist\npopd\n```\n\nThe penultimate step is to copy the actual presentations into the `public` directory and create a table of contents `index.html`.\nSuch a table of contents won't be very pretty but it is enough for debugging purposes.\nAnyways, everyone knows that software developers don't deserve pretty interfaces ;)\n```bash\necho \"copying presentations...\"\nfind . \\\n    -regex './[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]_[0-9][0-9]_[0-9][0-9]_[^/]+' \\\n    -exec cp -rv {} public \\;\n\necho \"creating table of contents page...\"\nfind . \\\n    -regex './[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]_[0-9][0-9]_[0-9][0-9]_[^/]+' \\\n    -exec echo \"<a href='{}'>{}<a><br />\" \\; > public/index.html\n```\n\n### Development Environment\nBecause no one wants to build everything over and over when they change a small detail, a few symlinks form a convenient dev environment.\nThis allows you to directly open your presentation `index.html` files as if they had already been copied into the `public` directory.\nYou can even use [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server), which can be installed with `yarn global add live-server`, to automatically reload the page when you change your presentation.\nIf you use VSCode, you can check out the [Live Server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).\n```bash\necho \"creating symlinks for development...\"\nln -svf public/dist dist\nln -svf public/plugin plugin\nln -svf public/dwn_vendor dwn_vendor\nln -svf public/index.html index.html\n```\n\nJust don't forget to compile right before publishing the `public` directory.\nOtherwise your changes wouldn't get deployed.\n\n## Clean Script\nIf you intend to undo a build or start a clean one&mdash;for example when you've changed the version of a dependency&mdash;you can use the `clean.sh` script.\n```bash\necho \"deleting reveal.js...\"\nrm -rvf reveal || true\n\necho \"deleting public dir...\"\nrm -rv public || true\n\necho \"deleting development symlinks...\"\nrm -v dist || true\nrm -v plugin || true\nrm -v dwn_vendor || true\nrm -v index.html || true\n```\n\n## Integrity Checks\nAutomated tests can really give you the confidence you need when standing in front of a crowd.\nSo far I have only included the most basic check there is, testing if all referred resources are actually accessible.\nThe `check.sh` script does just that.\n```bash\npython3 -m http.server 9329 > /dev/null 2>&1 & \\\n    to_kill=$! && \\\n    sleep 1 && \\\n    broken-link-checker \\\n    -or \\\n    --filter-level 3 \\\n    --input http://localhost:9329 \\\n    --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:99.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/99.0' || true && \\\n    kill $to_kill\n```\nThis script launches a local web server and silences all output by dumping it into `/dev/null`.\nThe single `&` executes this command in the background.\nEverything else is being executed in a separate process, which firstly sets the `to_kill` variable to the PID of the just-launched web server in the background.\nThen we wait a moment for the server to boot up and use the `broken-link-checker` program, which can be installed using `yarn global add broken-link-checker`.\nIn the end the web server gets shot down to avoid any zombie processes.\nThis is where the `to_kill` variable gets used.\n\n## Directory Overview\nWhat follows is an entire overview of [my presentations
