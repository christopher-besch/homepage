title: "Real-Time Application Development on Linux with PREEMPT RT"
description: "
While Linux is optimized for throughput and efficiency, real-time applications require bounded worst case latencies.
However, with the merging of PREEMPT RT, mainline Linux converts to a real-time operating system (RTOS).
Through presenting the application developer’s perspective and the changes PREEMPT RT introduces to the kernel, we review Linux’ real-time capabilities.
Additionally, we investigate dynamic worst case execution time (WCET) analysis using a StarFive VisionFive 2 as a case study.
Finally, we compare Linux to other RTOSes and argue that the lack of static WCET analysis is Linux’ main drawback for real-time applications.
