This privacy policy explains how I and any necessary third-party services use the personal data collected from you when you use my website.

## What data do I collect?
This website uses [umami](https://umami.is).
The umami server is hosted by Hetzner in Germany.
It collects the following data:
- time of access,
- what page you read,
- your operating system (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, ...),
- your type of browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, ...),
- if you're using a mobile device,
- the size of your screen,
- the referer (i.e. the page that linked you to my homepage),
- if you react (i.e., press a like or dislike button) to a page,
- the comments your write to a page,
- the time you spend on each page,
- your IP address and thus from what country you're accesing my homepage and
- some website diagnostics, like how long my homepage takes to load for you.

Take a look at [umami's features](https://umami.is/features) for more details.

This data is anonymized.
So I for example only know that ten people from Belgium visited my [article about reveal.js](/articles/revealjs) this month—not that **you** visited my page.

I plan on freely publishing this data at some point.
Also, I don't plan on deleting this data.

This data is used to help me understand what topics people are interested in and keep my motivation up.

In addition to that, my hoster [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) keeps an access log required to operate this website.
This access log includes most notably your IP address and access time stamps, which are stored (by Netlify) for less than 30 days.

Your IP address can be used to determine your rough physical location.
If you intend to keep your position secret, you are advised to utilize an anonymizing service such as the [Tor Network](https://www.torproject.org).

Your access time stamp can be used to identify you temporal location.
As of today, there is no established method of changing the flow of time.

You should read [Netlify's privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa) as their privacy notice applies.

## Privacy policies of other websites
My website contains links to other websites.
This privacy policy applies only to my website.
So if you click on a link to another website, you should read their privacy policy.

## Changes to my privacy policy
I keep my privacy policy under regular review and place any updates on this web page.
This privacy policy was last updated on 12th October 2022.
