The other day I bought a new, bigger camera making me feel like a big-boy photographer.
I took it out on a stroll and before the third shot, someone noticed my weighty device.
They were art students asking me if I could photograph their installations.
I did and it was fun until the sun set.</p>

<p>But why did they notice me?
Did they see <a href="/photography">my portfolio</a>?
Would they&#x27;ve noticed me if I had held my phone or a smaller camera?<br/>
Even though, the equipment really doesn&#x27;t make a good photographer.
A good photographer makes any equipment take good photos.
And then she still uses the best equipment for her job because of course she does.</p>
<p>Equipment, actually, is something I&#x27;m afraid of.
I&#x27;m afraid of my camera just being a toy I&#x27;m <em>consuming</em>.
Oh that word, <em>consumption</em>, what an insult!
This is <em>creation</em>, not <em>consumption</em>; this is a <em>tool</em> not a <em>toy</em>!<br/>
I don&#x27;t want the camera company to do the real work.
Like, pay them and they give you a device that <em>is</em> the photographer.
The real work should be mine; the technical, the artistic act of painting with light.</p>
<p>I envy screenshots in video games.
There&#x27;s no equipment in video games; just the photographer, her skills choosing motive, position, angle and time of day.
No matter how much money she threw someone&#x27;s way, everyone could have taken the same screenshot.<br/>
In a video game photography is reduced to expertise alone.<br/>
In real life, however, we don&#x27;t have that luxury.
We&#x27;re dependent on the likes of Sony, Canon and Nikon to build a real-life counterpart of the video games&#x27; <code>F12</code> key.
I want my photography to be as independent as possible, as much mine as possible.
I want to be independent of my tools.
Give me a Pentax, Olympus, analog, digital, mirrorless, smartphone or the <code>F12</code> key and I want to be good at creating.</p>
<p>When I was shopping for my new, bigger camera, I asked online what camera would fulfill my wishes.
And, to my surprise, a lot of what I wanted (better low-light performance, <em>better</em> colors) I could achieve with my previous camera.
I didn&#x27;t have to buy the new, bigger camera to do this; a little more expertise already does it.
There were other reasons for a new camera so I went that way.
I just told myself that the new sensor doesn&#x27;t invalidate all my previous work.<br/>
But still, I can&#x27;t help it.
I love feeling the weight in my gloved hands, streaking over the bold brand logo.
They are very pretty devices, made to do pretty things.
I want to appreciate that, acknowledge that but be independent of it.</p><div class="markdown_spacer"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="layout_footer"><a href="/about">Contact</a><a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a><div>© 2025 | All rights reserved</div></div></body></html>
