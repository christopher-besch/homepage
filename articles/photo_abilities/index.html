Though some of this is due to increased artistic expertise, there also are some concrete abilities I didn&#x27;t use to have.
Sometimes I just bought a new lens, enabling tack-sharp images, shallow depth of field or macro photography.
Other times I embraced raw photography and <a href="https://www.darktable.org">Darktable</a> to fix my exposure or correct a blown-out sky.
And again other times I ditched the automatic ISO and exposure time for manual exposure.
Those are all very technical abilities.
But not everything is technical in photography, right?</p>

<p>At some point I thought the best photographer could create an amazing photo in whatever situation she finds herself in.
I thought enough skill could negate adverse conditions.
But since then I&#x27;ve realized that, of course, the location, weather, time of day and day of year does make a huge impact.
For example, I started to carry my heavy camera around more often.
I also travel more; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlatornet">Karlatornet</a> doesn&#x27;t stand in Germany, I have to go to Sweden to photograph it.
My photography simply isn&#x27;t of the kind you do in your attic.<br/>
Oh and the sky.
The sky makes such a difference!
Realizing that getting up early or staying up late to catch golden hour is part of photography changed a world to me.
Consequently, I started getting really annoyed at the weather for being sunny on weekdays and cloudy on the weekend.
I&#x27;m an amateur photographer after all.</p>
<p>Analogue photography also had it&#x27;s impact on me.
When you only have 36 pictures you&#x27;d better make them count!
There are so many situations in which I know there&#x27;s a picture to take but I lack the abilities or simply came at the wrong time.
But I can feel it&#x27;s presence, I can experience it and let it pass.
That&#x27;s why I love optical viewfinders; they let me block out the entire world but the frame forever.
Then I can imagine the image I would&#x27;ve liked to take but can&#x27;t.<br/>
The other day, for example, light flooded our attic (talking about that attic).
So I went up there, photographing.
I spent half an hour crawling among the spider-webby boxes taking in the sunlight but not a single picture.
It simply didn&#x27;t work out; I couldn&#x27;t capture what I wanted to capture.
I think this is photography, too.<br/>
Every time I take a picture or fail at it I&#x27;m on the lookout for these abilities that I&#x27;ve acquired or am striving towards.
Thinking of discrete abilities, single steps to take, makes photography so much more approachable, so much less illusive.
It isn&#x27;t just a matter of <em>&quot;Other people get it, you don&#x27;t.&quot;</em>
That really motivates me to have fun with this hobby and get better at it.
And I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll find a lot more to photography in the years to come.</p><div class="markdown_spacer"></div></div></div><div class="title_in_text"><h1>Other Articles</h1><hr/></div><div class="cards_list"><a class="cards_list_card" href="/articles/the_photographer_and_her_camera"><picture class="image_picture"><img srcSet="/images/54a145d113acd5aed9dd5a5e3e9ff082_400_200.webp 400w,/images/54a145d113acd5aed9dd5a5e3e9ff082_800_400.webp 800w,/images/54a145d113acd5aed9dd5a5e3e9ff082_1200_600.webp 1200w,/images/54a145d113acd5aed9dd5a5e3e9ff082_1280_640.webp 1280w" width="400" height="200" style="background-image:radial-gradient(67% 67% at 25% 25%, #776e46, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 50% 25%, #8d835c, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 75% 25%, #98917f, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 25% 50%, #4f4b39, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 50% 50%, #786d4c, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 75% 50%, #9a8e6f, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 25% 75%, #2a2b25, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 50% 75%, #423f2e, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 75% 75%, #6f6448, transparent),linear-gradient(#6d664d);background-position:0 0, 0 100%;background-size:100% 100%;background-repeat:no-repeat"/></picture><h1>The Photographer and her Camera</h1><h2>Saturday, 22nd November, 2025</h2><hr/><p> I bought a new, bigger camera and want to be independent of it. </p></a><a class="cards_list_card" href="/articles/open_source"><picture class="image_picture"><img srcSet="/images/e5fdc90ab34ba9a541ab0d11b75e02de_400_200.webp 400w,/images/e5fdc90ab34ba9a541ab0d11b75e02de_800_400.webp 800w,/images/e5fdc90ab34ba9a541ab0d11b75e02de_1200_600.webp 1200w,/images/e5fdc90ab34ba9a541ab0d11b75e02de_1280_640.webp 1280w" width="400" height="200" style="background-image:radial-gradient(67% 67% at 25% 25%, #8e8784, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 50% 25%, #a69689, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 75% 25%, #bca38d, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 25% 50%, #695e66, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 50% 50%, #7a6368, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 75% 50%, #836168, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 25% 75%, #454d59, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 50% 75%, #5b525c, transparent),radial-gradient(67% 67% at 75% 75%, #7d585f, transparent),linear-gradient(#7f6f6f);background-position:0 0, 0 100%;background-size:100% 100%;background-repeat:no-repeat"/></picture><h1>Why I love Open-Source</h1><h2>Saturday, 11th October, 2025</h2><hr/><p> We all live in a world of immensely complex technology.

Regardless if you are a user, developer or simply interested in a healthy society, you benefit from Open-Source and we should fight for every bit of it.
